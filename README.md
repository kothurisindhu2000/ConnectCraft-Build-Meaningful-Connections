# ConnectCraft — LinkedIn Message Generator
ConnectCraft is a React-based application that helps users generate personalized and professional LinkedIn messages.
This project reflects my effort to strengthen my frontend development skills while building a tool that supports real-world networking and job-search needs.

## Purpose
As a student exploring opportunities in software development and Data Analyst, I often found it challenging and time-consuming to craft effective LinkedIn outreach messages.
To solve this, I built ConnectCraft — a tool that allows users to quickly create tailored messages for professional networking.
This project helped me learn React through a meaningful, practical application rather than through simple demo components.

## Key Features
Generate LinkedIn messages based on user inputs
Supports multiple message types:
```
Cold outreach
Referral requests 
Thank-you notes 
Follow-up messages
```
##### Tone customization: Friendly, Professional, or Short & Direct
##### Character limit toggle: 200 or 500 characters
##### Light/Dark mode using CSS variables
##### Local storage support for saving and revisiting messages
##### Options to copy, save, export (.txt or .md), or delete messages

### What I Learned
Through ConnectCraft, I strengthened several core frontend development skills, 
including building a complete React application using Vite’s fast development environment 
and managing dynamic UI behavior with React hooks such as useState and useEffect. 
I also learned how to persist user data with localStorage, implement light and dark themes using CSS variables, 
and design a modern glassmorphism-style interface with transparency and blur effects. 
Additionally, creating features like copy, save/export, and clear actions helped me 
improve user interaction design and build a smoother, more intuitive experience overall.

### Tech Stack
React (Vite)
TypeScript
CSS (Glassmorphism UI)
LocalStorage
