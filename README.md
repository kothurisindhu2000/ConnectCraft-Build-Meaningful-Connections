# ConnectCraft — LinkedIn Message Generator
ConnectCraft is a React-based application designed to help users generate personalized, professional LinkedIn messages. This project was built to apply my React knowledge to a practical, real-world problem, creating a tool that saves time and improves networking efficiency.

## Purpose
As a student exploring software development and data analysis, I wanted to build a project that is both useful and meaningful, rather than just a practice demo. Crafting effective LinkedIn messages can be time-consuming and challenging, so I developed ConnectCraft to generate tailored messages quickly.
This project allowed me to apply React, TypeScript, and UI design skills in a real-world scenario while delivering a practical tool that can help professionals in networking and career development.

## Key Features
Generate LinkedIn messages based on user input
**Multiple message types:**
```
Cold outreach
Referral requests
Thank-you notes
Follow-up messages
```
**Tone customization**: Friendly, Professional, or Short & Direct
**Character limit options**: 200 or 500 characters
Light/Dark mode using CSS variables
Save and revisit messages using localStorage
Copy, save, export (.txt or .md), or clear messages
